            Joburg, Egoli or City of Gold, was founded in 1886 due to the discovery of gold. It is currently the most
            visited city of the African continent, and for a reason. Johannesburg has a very rich history and a diverse
            cultural scene. There are plenty of interesting things to do in Johannesburg to keep you busy for a while.
            Did you know that Johannesburg is home to the largest man-made “urban” forest and has the largest “dry port”
            in the world? I have spent a lot of time in Joburg and while writing the previous article ‘Interesting facts
            about Johannesburg‘, I was pleasantly surprised to still discover many fascinating things about this city.

                        <li>The honey-coloured City Hall in Cape Town has seen many changes in its years of standing

                        <li>The Hall itself is made up of components from all over the world. The honey-coloured stone,
                            which makes up its façade of limestone, was imported from Bath in England. The tower houses
                            a clock and a number of bells, modelled on the famous Big Ben.</li>
