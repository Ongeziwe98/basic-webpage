        Johannesburg, also known as Jozi,
        Joburg, Egoli or City of Gold, was founded in 1886 due to the discovery of gold. It is currently the
        most
        visited city of the African continent, and for a reason. Johannesburg has a very rich history and a
        diverse
        cultural scene. There are plenty of interesting things to do in Johannesburg to keep you busy for a
        while.
        Did you know that Johannesburg is home to the largest man-made “urban” forest and has the largest “dry
        port”
        in the world? I have spent a lot of time in Joburg and while writing the previous article ‘Interesting
        facts
        about Johannesburg‘, I was pleasantly surprised to still discover many fascinating things about this
        city.

                <li>The Hall itself is made up of components from all over the world. The honey-coloured stone,
                    which makes up its façade of limestone, was imported from Bath in England. The tower houses
                    a clock and a number of bells, modelled on the famous Big Ben.</li>
